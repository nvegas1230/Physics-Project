# Physics 30S Final Project by Nevada Mullin
This is the repository for my unity project and it's code.  
To look at the scripts that are running the program, go to Assets -> Scripts.  
To download and use the program, switch to branch "builds" and follow the download instructions.  

My final project is a program called “Study Time”. I wanted to use a big game engine like Unity because of how prominent it is in creating popular games, and I thought it would be a good idea to learn how to use it. I am seriously considering going into computer engineering after high school, and I think learning how to code in Unity and C# could give me a boost in progress because computer engineers need to know how to create software. 

For the project itself, Study Time is a game/program that helps students study. It is not meant to teach everything in physics, which is why I created a disclaimer upon starting the program that tells them to use it as a tool for practicing information learned in class, instead of an alternative way to learn the content.
