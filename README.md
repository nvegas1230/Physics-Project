# Physics 30S Final Project by Nevada Mullin
This is the repository for my unity project and it's code.  
To look at the scripts that are running the program, go to Assets -> Scripts.  
To download and use the program, switch to branch "builds" and follow the download instructions.  

My final project is a program called “Study Time”. I refer to it as a program instead of a game because it does not have any gameplay elements included in it. I wanted to use a big game engine like Unity because of how prominent it is in creating popular games, and I thought it would be a good idea to learn how to use it. I am seriously considering going into computer engineering after high school, and I think learning how to code in Unity and C# could give me a boost in progress because computer engineers need to know how to create software. 

For the project itself, Study Time is a game/program that helps students study. It is not meant to teach everything in physics, which is why I created a disclaimer upon starting the program that tells them to use it as a tool for practicing information learned in class, instead of an alternative way to learn the content. 

Study Time does not currently have a Waves unit inside it. My reasoning behind this decision is that we are being taught concepts and formulas with waves until the end of the semester, and I would not be able to add information to waves that is taught later on in the final week (because it is due right at 3:30pm on Friday). I decided it would be better to polish the other units and add quality of life features, like a formula sheet, to the program. I also have to study for three exams and Cyber Patriot semi-finals, which leaves very little time to work on my project at the end of the semester, which is when waves are taught.
